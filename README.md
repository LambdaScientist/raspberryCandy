### Created by **[@tomWritesCode](https://twitter.com/tomWritesCode)**

### This them was inspired by my love of dark coding themes, Sarah Drasner's Night Owl theme, Wes Bos' Cobalt2 theme and Scott Tolinski's LevelUp Official Theme.

### The name of this comes from ONA Cafe in Marrickville in Sydney, Australia. My favorite roast they have is called Raspberry Candy and I have had way too many of those while at that cafe.

## If you like the theme let me know, I would love to hear it!
